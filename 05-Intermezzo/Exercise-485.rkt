;; Exercise 485.
;; A number tree is either a number or a pair of number trees.
;; Design sum-tree, which determines the sum of the numbers in a tree.


;; A Tree is one of:
;; - Number
;; - (list Tree Tree)


(define tree-0 10) ; 0 recursive steps

(define tree-1 (list 10 20)) ; 2 recursive steps

(define tree-2 (list 1 (list (list 2 4) 3))) ; 6 recursive steps

(define tree-3 (list (list 1 5) (list (list 2 4) 3))) ; 8 recursive steps


;; Tree -> Number
;; Determines the sum of the numbers in t.

;;; What is its abstract running time?
;; The program requires two recursive steps per one list item.
;; Hence the program takes on the order of n steps (more precisely, 2n steps)
;; on a tree with n pairs of numbers.

;;; What is an acceptable measure of the size of such a tree?
;; A quantaty of numbers or pairs on the tree.

;;; What is the worst possible shape of the tree?
;; A tree consisting of a large quantity of numbers grouped by pairs. 

;;; Whatâ€™s the best possible shape?
;; A tree consisting of one number.
