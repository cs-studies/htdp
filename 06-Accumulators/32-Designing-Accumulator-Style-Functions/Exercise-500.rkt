;; Exercise 500.
;; Design an accumulator-style version of how-many,
;; which is the function that determines the number of items on a list.


;; [X] [List-of X] -> Number
;; Calculates the number of items on the given list.
(check-expect (how-many '()) 0)

  (local ((define (how-many/acc l a)
            (cond
              [(empty? l) a]
              [else (how-many/acc (rest l) (add1 a))])))
    (how-many/acc l0 0)))


;;; The performance of how-many is O(n) where n is the length of the list.
;;; Does the accumulator version improve on this?
;; Yes, the performance is reduced to O(1).

;;; Does the accumulator reduce the amount of space needed to compute the result?
;; Yes, by the means of tail-call optimization.
