HTDP Exercises Solutions
===

**How to Design Programs** (HTDP) is one of the quite well-known books that provide an introduction to computer science.

HTDP teaches fundamentals of the programming in a detailed and comprehensible manner. It is a valuable source of information to both newbies starting their journey in the world of programming and programmers who strive to deepen their theoretical knowledge and improve practical skills.

This repository contains **solutions** to the **Second Edition** of the book.

### Prerequisites
- School-level math.
- [Discrete mathematics](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp-dp-1337694193/dp/1337694193/) knowledge would be a plus as it provides background to many topics discussed in HTDP.

### Tips

If you find some of the tasks to be difficult, it's okay. Take it easy: use the "baby steps" approach and make breaks from time to time. Studying the next sections of the material (or other resources on programming) may also help, since they may contain the clues you're lacking.

One example: the *first chapter* and, surprisingly, even the *prologue* can be challenging for beginners. They require using a relatively complex image library, which may get in the way while focusing on the topics being explained. [And may also result in a lot of time spent getting nicely looking results.]

With that in mind, **have happy coding**!
