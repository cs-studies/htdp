;; Exercise 395.
;; Design take.
;; It consumes a list l and a natural number n.
;; It produces the first n items from l or all of l if it is too short.

;; Design drop.
;; It consumes a list l and a natural number n.
;; Its result is l with the first n items removed or just â€™() if l is too short.


;; N is one of:
;; - 0

;; [List-of Number] N -> [List-of Number]
;; Produces the first n items from l.
