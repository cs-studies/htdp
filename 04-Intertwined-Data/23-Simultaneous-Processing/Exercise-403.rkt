;; Exercise 403.
;; Use struct spec to represent the databases from figure 137.


;; A Label is a String.

;; A Predicate is a [Any -> Boolean].

(define-struct spec [label predicate])
;; A Spec is a structure: (make-spec Label Predicate).

;; A Schema is a [List-of Spec].


;; A Cell is Any.
;; Constraint: cells do not contain functions.

;; A Row is a [List-of Cell].

;; A (piece of) Content is a [List-of Row].


(define-struct db [schema content])
;; A DB is a structure: (make-db Schema Content).
;; Integrity constraint:
;; for every row in content
;; - its length is the same as schema's (I1)
;; - its i-th Cell satisfies the i-th Predicate in schema (I2).
