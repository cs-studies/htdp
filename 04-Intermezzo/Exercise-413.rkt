;; Exercise 413.
;; Design inex*.
;; The function multiplies two Inex representations of numbers,
;; including inputs that force an additional increase of the output’s exponent.
;; Like inex+, it must signal its own error if the result is out of range,
;; not rely on create-inex to perform error checking.


;; N is one of:
;; - 0
;; - (add1 N)

;; An N99 is an N between 0 and 99 (inclusive).

;; An S is one of:
;; – 1
;; – -1
