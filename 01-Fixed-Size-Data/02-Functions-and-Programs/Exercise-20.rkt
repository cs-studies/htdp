;; Exercise 20.
;; Define the function string-delete,
;; which consumes a string plus a number i and deletes the ith position from str.
;; Assume i is a number between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the given string (exclusive).
;; See exercise 4 for ideas. Can string-delete deal with empty strings?

;; Definitions
(define (string-delete str i)
  (if (> (string-length str) 0)
      (string-append (substring str 0 i) (substring str (+ i 1)))
      ""))

;; Application
(string-delete "Funny_Faces" 5)
