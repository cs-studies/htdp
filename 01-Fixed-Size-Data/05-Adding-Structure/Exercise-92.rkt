;; Exercise 92.
;; Design the cham program,
;; which has the chameleon continuously walking
;; across the canvas from left to right.
;; To make the chameleon happy,
;; you feed it (down arrow, two points only);
;; petting isnâ€™t allowed.
;; "r" turns the chameleon red, "b" blue, and "g" green.
;; Start with a data definition, VCham, for representing chameleons.
