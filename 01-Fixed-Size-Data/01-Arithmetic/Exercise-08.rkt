;; Exercise 8.
;; Add the following line to the definitions area:
;; (define cat <image>)
;; Create a conditional expression that computes whether the image is tall or wide.
;; An image should be labeled "tall" if its height is larger than or equal to its width;
;; otherwise it is "wide".
;; Replace the cat with a rectangle of your choice to ensure that you know the expected answer.
;; Now try the following modification.
;; Create an expression that computes whether a picture is "tall", "wide", or "square".
