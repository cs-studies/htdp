Exercise 1. Add the following definitions for x and y to DrRacketâ€™s definitions area:
(define x 3)
(define y 4)
Now imagine that x and y are the coordinates of a Cartesian point.
Write down an expression that computes the distance of this point to the origin,
that is, a point with the coordinates (0,0).
To confirm that the expression works properly, change x to 12 and y to 5.
