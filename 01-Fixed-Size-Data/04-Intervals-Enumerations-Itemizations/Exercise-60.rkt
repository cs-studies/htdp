;; Exercise 60.
;; Implement an alternative data representation for a traffic light program
;; that uses numbers instead of strings.
;; Which implementation conveys its intention more clearly?

;; Answer.
;; Numbers representation conveys intention more clearly
;; since the traffic lights are switched in a particular order
;; and this order is easily represented by the Numbers.
;; Also, Numbers help to reduce clutter in this program,
;; even though texts are usually more human-readable.
;; Normally, Strings provide more semantics than Numbers.
;; But in this particular case, Strings just provide
;; presentational data (colors), not the program logic.
;; (Consider the case: the program is going to be used in Japan.
;; Then all the "green" strings would have to be replaced by "blue" strings.
;; That could require a big chunk of time for edits
;; in a large real-world program.)
;; Thus even a better choice would be to use constants
;; to represent possible states of the traffic light.
;; The constants would provide a single point of control over values
;; and be more human-readable then Numbers.

;; Data Definitions

;; An TrafficLight is one of the following Numbers:
;; – 0 [red]
;; – 1 [green]
;; – 2 [yellow]
;; Represents the possible states of a traffic light.

;; A BulbColor is one of the following Strings:
;; - "red"
;; - "green"
;; - "yellow"
;; Represents possible colors of traffic light bulbs.

;; An ImageMode is one of the following Strings:
;; - "outline"
;; - "solid"
;; Represents an image outline-mode.
