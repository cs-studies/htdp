;; Exercise 51.
;; Design a big-bang program
;; that simulates a traffic light for a given duration.
;; The program renders the state of a traffic light
;; as a solid circle of the appropriate color,
;; and it changes state on every clock tick.

(require 2htdp/universe)
(require 2htdp/image)


;;; Data Definitions
;; State is one of the following Strings:
;; "red", "green", "yellow".
;; Represents the possible states of a traffic light.
;;
;; Duration is a Number.
;; Represents the number of seconds
;; for a traffic light to stay in a set state.
;;
;; LensMode is one of the Strings:
;; "solid", "outline"
;; Represents a mode of a lens image.


;;; Constants Definitions
(define LENS-RADIUS 50)
