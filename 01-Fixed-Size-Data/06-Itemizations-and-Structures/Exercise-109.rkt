;;; Constants and Data Definitions

;; A KeyEvent is one of:
;; - "a"
;; - "b"
;; - "c"
;; - "d"
;; Represents key presses.

(define AA "white")
(define BB "yellow")
(define DD "green")
(define ER "red")

;; An FSMState is one of:
;; – AA
;; – BB
;; – DD 
;; – ER
;; Represents states of the finite state machine with
;; each state reached in a particular order on these events:
;; - AA on the initial "a" key press,
;; followed by
;; - BB on any number of "b" and "c" key presses,
;; - DD on "d" key press;
;; - and ER on not accepted key press.
;; The finite state machine with these states can be represented
;; by this regular expression:  a (b|c)* d
