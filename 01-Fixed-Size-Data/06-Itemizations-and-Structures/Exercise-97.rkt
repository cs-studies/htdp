;;; Data Definitions

;; A UFO is a Posn.
;; (make-posn x y) is the UFO's location,
;; using the top-down, left-to-right convention.

(define-struct tank [loc vel])
;; A Tank is a structure:
;;   (make-tank Number Number).
;; (make-tank x dx) specifies the x position
;; and the tank speed: dx pixels/tick.

;; A Missile is a Posn.
;; (make-posn x y) is the missile's position.

(define-struct aim [ufo tank])
;; An Aim is a structure:
;;     (make-aim UFO Tank)
;; Represents states getting tank in position for a shot.

(define-struct fired [ufo tank missile])
;; A Fired is a structure:
;;    (make-fired UFO Tank Missile)
;; Represents states after the missile is fired.

;;; Application

(define UFO (make-posn 50 190))
(define Tank (make-tank (make-posn 50 TANK-Y) -3))
(define Missile (make-posn 45 40))
(define s (make-fired UFO Tank Missile))

;; Compare expression 1
(tank-render
  (fired-tank s)
  (ufo-render (fired-ufo s)
              (missile-render (fired-missile s)
                              BACKGROUND)))

;; Compare expression 2
(ufo-render
  (fired-ufo s)
  (tank-render (fired-tank s)
               (missile-render (fired-missile s)
                               BACKGROUND)))

;; Answer.
;; The given expressions produce the same result when
;; the images of the UFO and the Tank do not overlap.
