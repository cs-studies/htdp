;;; SIGS

; A UFO is a Posn. 
; interpretation (make-posn x y) is the UFO's location 
; (using the top-down, left-to-right convention)
 
(define-struct tank [loc vel])
; A Tank is a structure:
;   (make-tank Number Number). 
; interpretation (make-tank x dx) specifies the position:
; (x, HEIGHT) and the tank's speed: dx pixels/tick 
 
; A Missile is a Posn. 
; interpretation (make-posn x y) is the missile's place

(define-struct aim [ufo tank])
(define-struct fired [ufo tank missile])

; A SIGS is one of: 
; – (make-aim UFO Tank)
; – (make-fired UFO Tank Missile)
; interpretation represents the complete state of a 
; space invader game

;; Any -> Boolean
;; Checks that v is an element of the SIGS collection.

;;; Coordinate

; A Coordinate is one of: 
; – a NegativeNumber 
; interpretation on the y axis, distance from top

; – a Posn
; interpretation an ordinary Cartesian point
