;; Exercise 98.
;; Design the function si-game-over? for use as the stop-when handler.
;;
;; Exercise 99.
;; Design si-move.
;; This function is called for every clock tick
;; to determine to which position the objects move now.
;;
;; Exercise 100.
;; Design the function si-control, which plays the role of the key-event handler.
;; Once you have this function, you can define the si-main function,
;; which uses big-bang to spawn the game-playing window.

;;; Data Definitions

;; A UFO is a Posn.
;; (make-posn x y) is the UFO's location,
;; using the top-down, left-to-right convention.

(define-struct tank [loc vel])
;; A Tank is a structure:
;;   (make-tank Number Number).
;; (make-tank x dx) specifies the x position
;; and the tank's speed: dx pixels/tick.

;; A Missile is a Posn.
;; (make-posn x y) is the missile's position.

(define-struct aim [ufo tank])
;; An Aim is a structure:
;;     (make-aim UFO Tank)
;; Represents states getting tank in position for a shot.

(define-struct fired [ufo tank missile])
;; A Fired is a structure:
;;    (make-fired UFO Tank Missile)
;; Represents states after the missile is fired.

;; A GameState is one of:
;; – (make-aim UFO Tank)
;; – (make-fired UFO Tank Missile)
;; Represents the complete state of a
;; space invader game.

;; A KeyEventMove is one of:
;; - "left"
;; - "right"
;; Represents a pressed key that sets
;; a movement direction of the tank.

;; A KeyEvent is one of:
;; - KeyEventMove
;; - " "
;; Represents a pressed key that triggers
;; a game state change.
