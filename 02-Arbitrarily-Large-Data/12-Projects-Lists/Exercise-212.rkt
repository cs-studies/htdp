;; Exercise 212.
;; Write down the data definition for List-of-words.
;; Make up examples of Words and List-of-words.
;; Finally, formulate the functional example from above with check-expect.


;; A Word is one of:
;; – '()
;; – (cons 1String Word)
;; Represents a list of 1Strings (letters).

;; A List-of-words is one of:
;; - (cons Word '())
;; - (cons Word List-of-words)
