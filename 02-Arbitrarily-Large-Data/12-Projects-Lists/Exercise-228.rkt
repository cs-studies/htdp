;;; Data Definitions

;; FSM-State is a Color.

(define-struct transition [current next])
;; A Transition is a structure:
;;    (make-transition FSM-State FSM-State)

;; An FSM is one of:
;; - '()
;; - (cons Transition FSM)
;; Represents the transitions that a finite state machine
;; can take from one state to another in reaction to keystrokes.

;; A SimulationState is a structure:
;;   (make-fs FSM FSM-State)
