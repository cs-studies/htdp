;; Exercise 150.
;; Design the function add-to-pi.
;; Once you have a complete definition, generalize the function to add,
;; which adds a natural number n to some arbitrary number x without using +.


;; An N is one of: 
;; – 0
;; – (add1 N)
;; Represents the counting numbers.


;; N -> Number
;; Computes (+ n pi) without using +.

;;; Answer
;; check-within is used because pi is an irrational number
;; and arbitrary number x can be an irrational number too.
;; Irrational numbers are not exact numbers,
;; so check-within with its delta parameter comes in handy
;; to test operations on irrational numbers.
