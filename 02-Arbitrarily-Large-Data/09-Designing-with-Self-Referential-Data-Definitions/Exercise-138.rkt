;; Exercise 138.
;; The following data definition represents sequences of amounts of money.
;; Design the sum function.


;; A List-of-amounts is one of: 
;; – '()
;; – (cons PositiveNumber List-of-amounts)
;; Represents sequences of amounts of money.

;; Examples:
;; '()
;; (cons 20 '())
;; (cons 20 (cons 30 '()))


;; List-of-amounts -> Number
;; Computes the sum of the amounts.
