;; Exercise 151.
;; Design the function multiply.
;; How does multiply relate to what you know from grade school?

;; An N is one of: 
;; – 0
;; – (add1 N)
;; Represents the counting numbers.


;; N Number -> Number
(check-expect (multiply 2 3) 6)
(check-expect (multiply 1 3) 3)
(check-expect (multiply 0 3) 0)
(check-expect (multiply 0 pi) 0)
(check-within (multiply 3 pi) (* 3 pi) 0.001)

;;; Answer
;; The flow of this function exhibits what multiplication is basically:
;; summing up some value with itself n times.
