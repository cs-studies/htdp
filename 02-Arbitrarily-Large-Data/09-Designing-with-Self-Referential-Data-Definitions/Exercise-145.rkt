;; Exercise 145.
;; Design the sorted>? predicate,
;; which consumes a NEList-of-temperatures
;; and produces #true if the temperatures are sorted in descending order.


;; A CTemperature is a Number greater than -272.

;; An NEList-of-temperatures is one of:
;; â€“ (cons CTemperature '())
;; â€“ (cons CTemperature NEList-of-temperatures)
;; Represents non-empty lists of Celsius temperatures.

;; NEList-of-temperatures -> Boolean
;; Determines if the temperatures are sorted in descending order.
