;; Exercise 160.
;; Design the functions set+.L and set+.R,
;; which create a set by adding a number x to some given set s
;; for the left-hand and right-hand data definition, respectively.


;; A Set-of-numbers-L is one of: 
;; – empty
;; – (cons Number Set-of-numbers-L)
;; May contain not unique numbers.
	
;; A Set-of-numbers-R is one of: 
;; – empty
;; – (cons Number Set-of-numbers-R)
;; Contains only unique numbers.


;; Set-of-numbers-L -> Set-of-numbers-L
;; Adds a number x to the given set s.
