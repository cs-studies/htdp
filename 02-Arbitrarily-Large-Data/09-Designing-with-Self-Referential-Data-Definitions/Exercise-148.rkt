;; Exercise 148.
;; Compare the function definitions from this section
;; (sum, how-many, all-true, one-true)
;; with the corresponding function definitions from the preceding sections.
;; Is it better to work with data definitions
;; that accommodate empty lists
;; as opposed to definitions for non-empty lists?
;; Why? Why not?


;; Answer
;; Data definitions that accommodate empty lists
;; cover more use cases with a bit simpler definitions and functions implementation.
;; Getting more at a lower cost usually is a preferred option.
