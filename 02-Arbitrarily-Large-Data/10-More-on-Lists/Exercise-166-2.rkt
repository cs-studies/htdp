;; Exercise 166.
;; Part 2.
;; Develop a data representation for employee information
;; and change the data definition for work records
;; so that it uses employee information
;; and not just a string for the employee’s name.
;; Also change your data representation of paychecks
;; so that it contains an employee’s name and number, too.
;; Finally, design wage*.v4,
;; a function that maps lists of revised work records to lists of revised paychecks.


;;; Data Definitions

(define-struct employee [id name])
;; An Employee is a structure:
;;   (make-employee Number String)
;; (make-employee id n) represents an employee
;; with the number id and the name n.

(define-struct paycheck [employee amount])
;; A Paycheck is a structure:
;;   (make-paycheck Employee Number)
;; (make-paycheck e a) combines the employee e
;; with the amount a.

;; A List-of-paychecks is one of:
;; - '()
;; - (cons Paycheck List-of-paychecks)

(define-struct work [employee rate hours])
;; A (piece of) Work is a structure: 
;;   (make-work Employee Number Number)
;; (make-work e r h) combines the employee e
;; with the pay rate r and the number of hours h.

;; A List-of-works is one of:
;; – '()
;; – (cons Work List-of-works)
;; Represents the hours worked for a number of employees.


;;; Constants

(define ROBBY (make-employee 33333 "Robby"))
(define MATTHEW (make-employee 99999 "Matthew"))


;;; Functions

;; List-of-works -> List-of-paychecks
;; Produces a list of paychecks.
