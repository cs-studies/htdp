;; Exercise 166.
;; Part 1.
;; Develop a data representation for paychecks.
;; Then design the function wage*.v3.
;; It consumes a list of work records and computes a list of paychecks from it, one per record.


;;; Data Definitions

(define-struct paycheck [employee amount])
;; A Paycheck is a structure:
;;   (make-paycheck String Number)
;; (make-paycheck n a) combines the name n
;; with the amount a.

;; A List-of-paychecks is one of:
;; - '()
;; - (cons Paycheck List-of-paychecks)

(define-struct work [employee rate hours])
;; A (piece of) Work is a structure: 
;;   (make-work String Number Number)
;; (make-work n r h) combines the name n
;; with the pay rate r and the number of hours h.

;; A List-of-works is one of:
;; – '()
;; – (cons Work List-of-works)
;; Represents the hours worked for a number of employees


;;; Functions

;; List-of-works -> List-of-paychecks
;; Produces a list of paychecks.
