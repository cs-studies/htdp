;; – '()
;; – (cons String List-of-names)
;; Represents a contact list for a cell phone.

;; List-of-names -> Boolean
;; Determines whether "Flatt" is on a-list-of-names.

;;; Answer
;; The results are the same because these expressions
;; are identical in the resulting evaluation flow.
;; At the moment of writing, "contains-flatt-if" way is the clearest to me.
;; It seems to be more of a matter of personal taste and perception.
