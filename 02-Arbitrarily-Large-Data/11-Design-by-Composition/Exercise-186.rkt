;;; Answer
;;
;; Any check-expect() testing sort>/bad given not sorted list
;; will fail correctly, showing that sort>/bad is not a sorting function.
;; For example: (check-expect (sort>/bad (list 1 2 3)) (list 3 2 1))
;;
;; check-satisfied cannot be used, because sort>/bad always returns
;; a static sorted list. This way, sort>/bad always satisfies sorted>? predicate,
;; returning the sorted (list 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0) given any argument.
